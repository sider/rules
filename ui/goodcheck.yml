  message: |
    Using HSL(hue, saturation, lightness) is a better way to work with colors.
    It's much easier to find colors with the same value by editing the hue.
    It also works well for programmatic color control.

    Consider including a color system with a few shades of grey so you don't have to compromise.
    This also helps speed up selection by reducing the amount of greys to select from.
    Also name it by lightness between 0 and 100 for easy reference. e.g. color-gray-05.
